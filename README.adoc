This repository contains a tiny chess engine written from scratch in the Nim programming language.
The engine uses the well known alpha-beta-pruning for move reduction and a transposition table
to recover already evaluated positions fast.
The possible moves of a chess piece on the board are pre-calculated, in a similar way as it
was done in early GNU chess in the late 1980s. No special chess knowledge is used, and complicated
stuff like the use of bitboards have been avoided. The result is a tiny and simple chess engine, which still
is a good opponent for human players. The whole chess engine module contains about 1k lines of code only, and the
actual engine procedure called abeta() has only 300 lines of code. One disadvantage of this chess engine is, that
it uses a lot of RAM: For running it, your computer should have a few GB main memory, at least 2 GB. Using the engine with
only 1 GB of RAM should be possible, when you reduce the size of the transposition table, but that reduces
the playing strength. But even oldest laptops, cellphones or the raspberry pi should provide the necessary 2 GB.

Currently two very basic frontends are available, one for GTK3, and one for GTK4.
The generated executables are only 100KB in size!

This chess engine should be a good start for people who want to understand how a simple chess
engine works, and who want to create a custom GUI frontend. As the engine is so tiny and simple,
converting to other programming languages should be really easy.

This engine is actually based on an early, ugly draft created in 2015 called nim-chess4. The fact that the final
engine is so simple and tiny does not really mean that creating it was not some effort. While use of alpha-beta-pruning
and use of a transposition table is really simple on its own, its combination can generate some problems.
And debugging recursive code like a chess algorithm can be hard: We may have totally spend 300 hours for creating the algorithm,
200 hours for debugging, and 50 hours for the GTK front end.

=== Properties of the engine

- written in Nim language
- basic GTK3 and GTK4 GUI using high level gintro API
- only 1500 lines of pure Nim code, only 300 lines for the actual engine procedure
- move generation is based on an old gnuchess idea
- core component is of course alpha-beta-prunning
- a transposition table is used to store and reuse old results

With a time limit of a few seconds per move computation is generally 7 ply deep
full width, with additional full capture analyses (quiescence search). Special moves
like chess offers or captures can be depth extended (disabled by default), which may further increase
playing strength, but we have not yet really verified that.
In endgame
depth of 10 ply and more is archived -- now even the most difficult endgame
king vs king/bishop/knight is solved in few moves/seconds. And we have added a set based
history to prevent engine from repeating old positions.

Currently the board and the transposition table are global variables, and some other global variables are used as well.
It should be not difficult for you to use a board parameter for the abeta() proc, to get a more
OOP like behaviour. Using a value parameter for the board, would further simplify the engine, as
undoing moves would not be necessary.
Of course an opening library would further increase playing strength, it should be easy for you to add
one when you want it. Loading and saving games should be an easy exercise for you as well.
And adding chess clocks, a way to set up positions, to specify time restrictions or choose the colors for
human and computer is trivial. A bit more demanding is running the engine in the background when
longer time periods per move are desired -- this may depend on the actual GUI toolkit you may intend to use.
Creating a chess engine which works in parallel on multiple CPU cores is a more difficult task --
as a starting point you could make the move generation parallel, which should be not that difficult, but
may not increase performance that much. 

The graphical user interface is very basic currently -- we play with white pieces against
the computer. No undo, no hints. For next game we have to restart the program. At least the GUI
is one more example for the use of the gintro Nim GTK bindings

Maybe we will describe the engine in some more detail in a next edition of the Nim book, as some people have
asked for a section about game and GUI programming. 

=== Installation

We assume that you have already a working Nim compiler available on your box.

For Linux:

First install gintro, the gobject-introspection based high level GTK3 and GTK4 bindings
https://github.com/StefanSalewski/gintro with this command:

----
nimble install gintro
----

And then

----
git clone https://github.com/stefansalewski/salewski-chess.git
cd salewski-chess

nim c --opt:speed board_gtk4.nim
./board_gtk4

Or when you should still have only old GTK3 available:

nim c --opt:speed board_gtk3.nim
./board_gtk3

After first tests, you may try for best performance and a tiny executable:
nim c -d:danger -d:useMalloc --gc:arc -d:lto --passc:-march=native board_gtk4.nim
----

It may be possible to use it on Windows or with MacOSX as well. You may also compile it
with -d:salewskiChessDebug to get some debugging output.
